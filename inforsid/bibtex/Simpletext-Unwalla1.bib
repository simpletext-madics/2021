	abstract = {In commerce and industry, many organizations use plain language, for example, µSlain EngliVh¶ and µlenguaje claro¶ [SSaniVh]. For safety-critical documentation, plain language is not always sufficient, and some organizations use controlled language. ASDSTE100 Simplified Technical English is a specification for a controlled language. In this paper, we present the TechScribe term checker for ASD-STE100, which checks a document for conformity to ASD-STE100. Many of the ASD-STE100 rules are applicable to the simplification of scientific texts. To show that, this paper conforms to ASD-STE100 as much as possible.},
